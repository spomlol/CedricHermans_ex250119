Question 12:

Steps: 
    go to: https://rest.ensembl.org/
    Search for variation
    choose: GET variation/:species/:id 	Uses a variant identifier (e.g. rsID) to return the variation features including optional genotype, phenotype and population data
    Make query: 'https://rest.ensembl.org/variation/mouse/rs4224828?' -H 'Content-type:xml'
    Look in results for "mappings: location"
    
    curl 'https://rest.ensembl.org/variation/mouse/rs4224828?' -H 'Content-type:xml'
    
    (Chose xml to increase readability in the terminal)

Question 13:

Steps:
    go to: https://rest.ensembl.org/
    search for cross references
    choose: GET xrefs/symbol/:species/:symbol 	Looks up an external symbol and returns all Ensembl objects linked to it. This can be a display name for a gene/transcript/translation, a synonym or an externally linked reference. If a gene's transcript is linked to the supplied symbol the service will return both gene and transcript (it supports transient links).
    I happen to know that the zebrafish's scientific name is danio rerio, so I can perform the query is following:
    curl 'https://rest.ensembl.org/xrefs/symbol/danio_rerio/MYCN?' -H 'Content-type:application/json'
    Grab this ENS id: ENSDARG00000006837
    Go to Sequence: GET sequence/id/:id 	Request multiple types of sequence by stable identifier. Supports feature masking and expand options.
    Make query with ENS id
    curl 'https://rest.ensembl.org/sequence/id/ENSDARG00000006837?type=genomic' -H 'Content-type:text/x-fasta'
    Header says: chromosome:GRCz11:20:33294428:33299384:1
    Go to sequence: GET sequence/region/:species/:region 	Returns the genomic sequence of the specified region of the given species. Supports feature masking and expand options.
    Make query: (regionstart till regionstart+99)
    curl 'https://rest.ensembl.org/sequence/region/danio_rerio/20:33294428..33294527:1?' -H 'Content-type:text/x-fasta'
