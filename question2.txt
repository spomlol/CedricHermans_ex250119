Unnormalized form: Just list all the possible columns
    DB(PersNo, Name, DateOfBirth, LabCode, LabName, ResearchCode, ResearchDescription, Research supervisor)

First normalized form: Remove repeating elements, add primary keys to every table, no columns may represent the same data
        => ResearchCode, ResearchDescription, Research supervisor are repeating
        => PersNo is key in first table
        => PersNo and ResearchCode are keys from second table

    DB(PersNo, Name, DateOfBirth, LabCode, LabName)
    Research(PersNo, ResearchCode, ResearchDescription, Research supervisor)
        keys(PersNo)
        keys(PersNo, ResearchCode)
        
Second normalized form: Should be in 1NF and each element should be dependend on the whole key, not on the subkey
        => ResearchDescription, Research supervisor are only dependend on ResearchCode, not PersNo
    
    DB(PersNo, Name, DateOfBirth, LabCode, LabName)
    Research(PersNo, ResearchCode)
    ResearchDetail(ResearchCode, ResearchDescription, Research supervisor)
        keys(PersNo)
        keys(PersNo, ResearchCode)
        keys(ResearchCode)
        
Third normalized form: should be in 2NF and each element should be non transitively dependend on the whole key (aka: a non-key should not depend on another non-key)
        => LabName is dependend on Labcode, which is not a key
