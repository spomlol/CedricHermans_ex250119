Question 4:

    select gene_name,seq_region_end-seq_region_start+1 as length from gene order by length;

        # gene_name, length
        'TRDD1', '8'

Question 5:

    select gene.gene_name,count(*) as NoTranscripts from gene, transcript where gene.gene_id= transcript.gene_id group by gene.gene_id order by NoTranscripts DESC limit 1;

        # gene_name, NoTranscripts
        'NDRG2', '80'

Question 6:

1:
    select gene.chromosome, count(*) as NoGenes from gene where gene.description like "%cancer%" group by gene.chromosome order by NoGenes DESC limit 1,1;
    
        # chromosome, NoGenes
        '9', '5'
2:
    select count(distinct(exon.exon_id)) as NumberOfExones from transcript, exon_transcript,exon,gene where transcript.transcript_id= exon_transcript.transcript_id and exon_transcript.exon_id=exon.exon_id and transcript.gene_id=gene.gene_id and gene.chromosome=9;

        # NumberOfExones
        '24097'
        
Question 7:

Query:

    select count(*) from exon;
    select count(*) from exon_transcript;

Result:

    642590
    1178393

Answer: 1 transcript can be a result of multiple exons, and an exon can be part of multiple transcripts. so it is a many-to-many relationship cross-reference table.
